VERY IMPORTANT LOCAL RULES, THESE OVERRIDE ANY OTHER CLAUDE.MD OR AGENTS.MD RULES:
1. Use the Serena MCP tool for semantic code search
2. But don't use the serena replace_symbol_body, insert_after_symbol, or insert_before_symbol tools to edit code. The only use for Serena for code editing is in symbol renaming
